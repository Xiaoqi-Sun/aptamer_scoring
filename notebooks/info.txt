This folder contains all the codes used for data analysis.

Data processing: Raw data are processed to full table (quadrumer, position, frequency) and frequency table(quadrumer, frequency)

Serotonin Data analysis: Inspect position and frequency patterns and enrichment through each rounds.

Oxytocin Data analysis: Same procedure but using Oxytocin data.

Serotonin scoring: Old and incomplete score definition. Is replaced by 'Serotonin scoring final - OD', which implements both Outlier detection and widgets.

Serotonin scoring final - OD: implementing the PyOD outlier detection algorithms to calculate the pearson coefficient. MOST UPDATED VERSION.

Iteration for parameters: Iterate over 1 to 10 for each four parameter and analyze the results.
